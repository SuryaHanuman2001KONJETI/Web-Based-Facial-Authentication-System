This project implements a secure web-based authentication mechanism using facial recognition combined with liveness detection. Instead of relying on traditional passwords, the system confirms both the identity and physical presence of a user through real-time webcam input.

🚀 Features

Real-time face detection and recognition

Liveness detection to prevent photo/video spoofing

User registration and face-based login

Secure session-controlled dashboard

Simple and intuitive web interface

🛠️ Technologies Used

Backend: Python, Flask

Computer Vision: OpenCV (LBPH algorithm)

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Database: Local storage for user data

⚙️ System Workflow

User registers with personal details and facial data

Facial features are captured and processed

During login, live face data is matched with stored data

Liveness is verified through movement detection

Authenticated users gain access to the dashboard

🔐 Security Highlights

Eliminates password-based vulnerabilities

Prevents impersonation using static images

Session-based access control

📈 Future Enhancements

Deep learning–based face recognition

Advanced liveness detection techniques

Cloud database integration

Multi-factor authentication support

📚 Use Case

Ideal for academic projects, cybersecurity demonstrations, and learning practical biometric authentication concepts.
